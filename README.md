[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/i7fp97q9nc5uw5kf?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/zhengbli/typescript-tmlanguage)

This repository contains TmLanguage files that are consumed by TypeScript editors and plugins such as [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode), [The TypeScript Sublime Plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Sublime-Plugin), [Atom TypeScript](https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript), and possibly others.

Latest version of the grammer can be also found as a [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.typescript-javascript-grammar).

# Contributing

The XML files are generated from the YAML files, so contributors should hand-modify the YAML files, and XML files should only be generated by running build script.

## Build

Update the XML files from within the ```build``` folder

``` sh
cd build
npm install         # Installs dependencies required for building
npm start           # Compiles & builds the XML files
```

## Tests

Test are run from within the ```tests``` folder and depend on build to make sure XML files are upto date

``` sh
cd build
npm install         # Installs dependencies required for building

cd ../tests
npm install         # Installs dependencies required for testing
npm test            # Compiles & runs tests
```
